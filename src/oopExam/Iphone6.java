	/* First write about method over loading and method overriding with multiple line comments here
	 * Now, Think about Iphone6. It also has 6 methods with the same name as
	 * materials(). For example -- They are return type parameterized method (int ramPrice, int
	 * cameraPrice), another one return type parameterized method (int ramPrice, int cameraPrice, String
	 * ProcessorPrice), etc. Can you use the void, parameterized(return type), final (return type), or static (return type)
	 * method here as the same method name? if yes, create them and take more int
	 * variable of your own. What kind of concept you can use? [points: 70].
	 * Instantiate the class in TestPhone and initialize those methods. [points:
	 * 70]. 
	 * Now think about a regular class Name ConfiguredIphone6 which extends
	 * Iphone6. Override those methods of Iphone6 and change the logic at your own to show the
	 * changes. [points: 50]. Show the output in TestPhone (how many methods is
	 * possible to extends). [points: 50]. 
	 * 
	 * Please make sure you organize the code in every class
